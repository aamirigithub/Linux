What is "command /dev/null 2>&1 means" --> any output of command will go to null STDOUT box and error to STDERR box 
> redirect the program’s output somewhere (In this case, something is being redirected into /dev/null)
Standard in, out and err are buit-in numbered 0, 1, and 2 in Linux / STDIN=0, STDOUT=1, STDERR=2

grep         Main Options 
-c                 count the number of lines matching PATTERN 
-f                 obtain PATTERN from a file 
-i                 ignore case sensitivity 
-n                 Include the line number of matching lines 
-v                 output all lines except those containing PATTERN 
-w                 Select lines only if the pattern matches a whole word.
-o                Print only what you matched
-P                Use Perl-style regular expressions
-E                 tells, that you want to use extended regex
-r                 grep is looking for result recursively in the folder

${Pattern Matching}
Here is a table of regular expression operators and their effect :
Operator        Effect
.                Matches any single character.
?                The preceding item is optional and will be matched, at most, once.
*                The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
+                The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
{N}                The preceding item is matched exactly N times.
{N,}        The preceding item is matched N or more times.
{N,M}        The preceding item is matched at least N times, but not more than M times.
-                represents the range if its not first or last in a list or the ending point of a range in a list.
^                Matches the empty string at the beginning of a line; also represents the characters not in the range of a list.
$                Matches the empty string at the end of a line.
\b                Matches the empty string at the edge of a word.
\B                Matches the empty string provided its not at the edge of a word.
\<                Match the empty string at the beginning of word.
\>                Match the empty string at the end of word.

        -p80-1200,8000-8005,900-1000
        -p-100,1000-        You can omit the beginning of a range to imply port one, or the end to imply the last port possible (65535 for TCP and UDP, 
                255 for protocol scan). This example scans ports one through 100, and all ports greater or equal to 60,000.
        -p-   Omit beginning and end numbers to scan the whole range (excluding zero).
        -pT:21,23,110,U:53,111,137,161  Separate lists of TCP and UDP ports can be given by preceding the lists with T: (for TCP) or U:. This 
                example scans three TCP ports (FTP, Telnet, and POP3), and four UDP services (DNS, rpcbind, NetBIOS, and SNMP). Specifying both TCP and UDP ports only matters if you also tell Nmap to do a UDP scan (-sU) and one of the TCP scan methods, such as -sS, -sA, or -sF.
        -p http*                   Wildcards may be used to match ports with similar names. This expression matches eight port numbers, including http (80), 
                http-mgmt (280), https (443), and http-proxy (8080). 
        -p 1-1023,[1024-]                Enclosing a range in brackets causes those port numbers to be scanned only if they are registered in nmap-services. 
                In this example, all the reserved ports (1–1,023), plus all the higher ports registered in nmap-services.

-sA                TCP ACK scan , ACK scan is commonly used to map out firewall rulesets. In particular, it helps understand whether firewall rules are                 
        stateful or not. The downside is that it cannot distinguish open from closed ports.
-sT         TCP connection scan
-sS         TCP SYNC (Stealth) Scan
-sU         UDP scan
-sW                TCP Window scan, Window scan is like ACK scan, except that it is able to detect open versus closed ports against certain machines.
-sF         FIN scan - A FIN scan sends the packet only set with a FIN flag, so it is not required to complete the TCP handshaking.
-sP         PING scan
-sN                NULL scan
-sO                IP Protocol scan, Protocol scan determines which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by the target machine. This isnt 
        technically a port scan, since it cycles through IP protocol numbers rather than TCP or UDP port numbers.
-sX                Xmas scan
-sM                TCP Maimon Scan, his obscure firewall-evading scan type is similar to a FIN scan, but includes the ACK flag as well. This allows it to get 
        by more packet filtering firewalls. 
-sV         Version detection
-sI                TCP Idle Scan, Idle scan is the stealthiest scan type of all, and can sometimes exploit trusted IP address relationships. Unfortunately, it 
        is also slow and complex.
-oA         fileName save files as logs
-oN/-oX/-oG/-oS This writes the results to a file that we can use for later analysis
-sI         Idle scan -  In idle scan, Nmap doesn’t send the packets from your real IP address—instead of generating the packets from the attacker 
        machine, Nmap uses another host from the target network to send the packets. Let’s consider an example to understand the concept of idle scan
--log-errors                 include error logs 
--reason                         This tells nmap to provide the reason that a ports state was reported a certain way.
--append-output         Append logs to output file

`Geo location`
The ip-geolocation-maxmind script depends on a database that is not included in Nmap by default. Download Maxminds GeoLite City database in binary format from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/ and place it in your local Nmap data folder (/nselib/data/) inside your installation directory. The ip-geolocation-ipinfodb script requires an API key to query an external service. The service is free, and you only need to register at http://ipinfodb.com/register.php to get one. This service does not limit the number of queries, but connections are only processed from one IP address that you need to register during the signup process.

nmap '-sT' '-sU' '-T4' '-PE' '-PA139,445,22,161' 10.132.35.20

nmap -v 10.132.35.20         This option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine IP. The -v option enables verbose mode.

nmap -sS -O scanme.nmap.org/24
nmap -sS -O 10.132.35.20/24                 Launches a stealth SYN scan against each machine that is up out of the 256 IPs on the class C sized network where Scanme resides. It also tries to determine what operating system is running on each host that is up and running. This requires root privileges because of the SYN scan and OS detection.

nmap -sV -p 22,53,110,143,4564 198.116.0-255.1-127                Launches host enumeration and a TCP scan at the first half of each of the 255 possible eight-bit subnets in the 198.116 class B address space. This tests whether the systems run SSH, DNS, POP3, or IMAP on their standard ports, or anything on port 4564. For any of these ports found open, version detection is used to determine what application is running.

nmap -v -iR 100000 -Pn -p 80                Asks Nmap to choose 100,000 hosts at random and scan them for web servers (port 80). Host enumeration is disabled with -Pn since first sending a couple probes to determine whether a host is up is wasteful when you are only probing one port on each target host anyway.

nmap -Pn -p80 -oX logs/pb-port80scan.xml -oG logs/pb-port80scan.gnmap 216.163.128.20/20                This scans 4096 IPs for any web servers (without pinging them) and saves the output in grepable and XML formats.

`Distributed nmap - DNMAP`
Download the latest version of Dnmap from the official SourceForge repositories at https://sourceforge.net/projects/dnmap/files/.
Dnmap depends on Pythons twisted library. If you are on a Debian-based system, you can install it with the following command:

apt-get install libssl-dev python-twisted

It is also worth mentioning that Nmap is not self-contained in Dnmap; we must install it separately on each client. Please refer to the Compiling Nmap from source code

`Anonymous Port Scanning: Nmap + Tor + ProxyChains` 
Posted on Tuesday December 27th, 2016by admin  
In this article i will explain how to stay anonymous during port scanning with Nmap (utility for network discovery and security auditing). 
I’ll show how to perform an anonymous port scanning through the Tor network, using ProxyChains utility. 
I’ll also show how to get round a situation where scan fails, because Tor endpoints are blocked.

# Basic Scanning Techniques
nmap [target]                                                Scan a single target —> 
nmap [target1,target2,etc]                        Scan multiple targets —>

`How do I perform a fast scan?`
nmap -F 192.168.1.1

#11: Display the reason a port is in a particular state

nmap --reason 192.168.1.1
nmap --reason server1.cyberciti.biz

#12: Only show open (or possibly open) ports

nmap --open 192.168.1.1
nmap --open server1.cyberciti.biz

#13: Show all packets sent and received

nmap --packet-trace 192.168.1.1
nmap --packet-trace server1.cyberciti.biz

# 14: Show host interfaces and routes

This is useful for debugging (ip command or route command or netstat command like output using nmap)

nmap --iflist

#16: The fastest way to scan all your devices/computers for open ports ever

nmap -T5 192.168.1.0/24

#17: How do I detect remote operating system?

You can identify a remote host apps and OS using the -O option:

nmap -O 192.168.1.1
nmap -O  --osscan-guess 192.168.1.1
nmap -v -O --osscan-guess 192.168.1.1

#18: How do I detect remote services (server / daemon) version numbers?

nmap -sV 192.168.1.1

#19: Scan a host using TCP ACK (PA) and TCP Syn (PS) ping

If firewall is blocking standard ICMP pings, try the following host discovery methods:

nmap -PS 192.168.1.1
nmap -PS 80,21,443 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 192.168.1.1
nmap -PA 80,21,200-512 192.168.1.1

#20: Scan a host using IP protocol ping

nmap -PO 192.168.1.1

#21: Scan a host using UDP ping

This scan bypasses firewalls and filters that only screen TCP:

nmap -PU 192.168.1.1
nmap -PU 2000.2001 192.168.1.1

#23: Scan a host for UDP services (UDP scan)

Most popular services on the Internet run over the TCP protocol. DNS, SNMP, and DHCP are three of the most common UDP services. Use the following syntax to find out UDP services:

nmap -sU nas03
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1

#24: Scan for IP protocol

This type of scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines:

nmap -sO 192.168.1.1

#25: Scan a firewall for security weakness

The following scan types exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP and good for testing security of common attacks:

## TCP Null Scan to fool a firewall to generate a response ##
## Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) ##
nmap -sN 192.168.1.254
 
#TCP Fin scan to check firewall ## #Sets just the TCP FIN bit ##
nmap -sF 192.168.1.254
 
## TCP Xmas scan to check firewall ##
## Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree ##
nmap -sX 192.168.1.254

#28: Scan a firewall for MAC address spoofing

### Spoof your MAC address ##
nmap --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
 
### Add other options ###
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.1
 
 
### Use a random MAC address ###
### The number 0, means nmap chooses a completely random MAC address ###
nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac 0 192.168.1.1

#30 Scans for web servers and pipes into Nikto for scanning

nmap -p80 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -
nmap -p80,443 192.168.1.2/24 -oG - | /path/to/nikto.pl -h -

# SNMP is typically used as the source for a Network Management System as the NMS can mine the wealth of vendor specific SNMP status and configuration information regarding each device to provide a holistic view of the network.
`SNMP Commands
    GET – is the command to retrieve an OID from the MIB
    GET-Next – is the command to walk through the MIB tree going from one OID to the next, this is the command SNMP-walk is based on.
    SET – write a value in a parameter
    TRAP – send an error message or alert due to a configurable threshold being passed or a trigger activated

opt    – Special options for that specific rule.
source – Source ip-address of the packet
destination – Destination ip-address for the packet

ACCEPT – To let the packet through the firewall
DROP   – To drop the packet on the floor
QUEUE  – Firewall will pass the packet to the userspace.
RETURN – Firewall will stop executing the next set of rules in the current chain for this packet. The control will be returned to the calling chain

-A     - Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain
-C     - Check  whether  a  rule matching the specification does exist in the selected chain
-D     - Delete  one  or  more rules from the selected chain

If a file is accessed with ‘A‘ attribute set, its atime record is not updated.
If a file is modified with ‘S‘ attribute set, the changes are updates synchronously on the disk.
A file is set with ‘a‘ attribute, can only be open in append mode for writing.
A file is set with ‘i‘ attribute, cannot be modified (immutable). Means no renaming, no symbolic link creation, no execution, no writable, only superuser can unset the attribute.
A file with the ‘j‘ attribute is set, all of its information updated to the ext3 journal before being updated to the file itself.
A file is set with ‘t‘ attribute, no tail-merging.
A file with the attribute ‘d‘, will no more candidate for backup when the dump process is run.
When a file has ‘u‘ attribute is deleted, its data are saved. This enables the user to ask for its undeletion.
+ : Adds the attribute to the existing attribute of the files.
– : Removes the attribute to the existing attribute of the files.
= : Keep the existing attributes that the files have.

${SSH access}
ssh_config is for ssh clients (i.e running ssh from the command line) and sshd_config is for the sshd server.
add following to file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

# User account authentication
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
Change        PasswordAuthentication yes 
and         ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
Add         AllowUsers aamir
Restart ssh /etc/init.d/ssh restart.
Better you use service sshd restart

# Root account authentication
PermitRootLogin yes                                
AllowUsers root                                                # allow root access
DenyUsers root
DenyGroups root

# Other settings on demand
AllowUsers user1 user2
AllowGroups group1 group2
DenyUsers user1 user2 user3                                # deny user from access)
DenyGroups group1 group2

watch "tail -n -20 /var/log/secure | grep sshd"    (# to trace any problem with sshd login)

# SHH PUB/PRIV key access -- change sshd_config
.ssh and everything under it should be owned by the user itself and only the user should have permission. 
chown -R <user> ~<user>/.ssh; chmod 700 ~<user>/.ssh;chmod 600 ~<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys should do the trick.

SELinux on RedHat/CentOS 6 has an issue with pubkey authentication, probably when some of the files are created selinux is not setting its ACLs correctly. To manually fix the SElinux ACLs for the root user:
restorecon -R -v /root/.ssh

Gerate Key using Putty Key Generator (PuttyGen) - PuttyGen will create a public key file that looks like:

$ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABJQAAAQEAvXTiVAsUZoTUwKQBO7o3t2H5mrCUhElrgBgWO6DVv1+j92HOqkzV3vjw+1oN8zlcwP56t43m4EGNzhnJZZrQunvFBQMM4wSqAN5Z35WtLWu2lk2A0HzGaVTAjhRMJ+/4uEEtV41+S7d0kDLNvGeZ7e3C0uiuQRYtX4VDcEhPrvnFmtzLbTD4GeCXeg2/k5oxVlNWhKDcX/auCEju6duU41RPBRYilDXYogMQmQyHmaybUmMenGS1VM3C/fZ8SsTTPCM/2Y+OTwNA43XaFqcD26Yd4uEXxQ3eCGRN68DssNJD3bueTARxGVPvXL4JyzmLQHHSnWr4lny0vEkuo7x6qQ== rsa-key-20190729

Open the key in PuttyGen, and then copy it from there (this results in the key being in the right format and in 1 line):
Paste this into authorized_keys then it should work.

RSAAuthentication                yes
PubkeyAuthentication        yes
AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys
AllowUsers <user-name>
AllowUsers root
service sshd restart
ssh -vvv user@<host-name>                                                 # deep method for ssh debugging by using -vvv

# SSH access with password  
create user account and password
Add user to sshd_config file
AllowUsers user
service sshd restart

# Retrieve Your Public Key from Your Private Key
$ssh-keygen -y

# SSH access through Public/Private key, https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server
/home/user
mkdir .ssh
Copy the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys folder on the remote machine
e.g,. cp id_rsa.pub /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys
Depends on desktop environment, a window may appear prompting for a password. Otherwise, Linux prompt will appear. This password is the passphrase you created for the private key encryption.

# Reverse SSH Tunnel
https://www.howtogeek.com/428413/what-is-reverse-ssh-tunneling-and-how-to-use-it/
ssh -fN -R 7000:localhost:22 username@yourMachine-ipaddress                # To create SSH reverse tunneling on remote host
`
        
    The -R (reverse) option tells ssh that new SSH sessions must be created on the remote computer.
    The “7000:localhost:22” tells ssh that connection requests to port 7000 on the local computer should be forwarded to port 22 on the remote computer. Port 7000 was chosen because it is listed as being unallocated. It isn’t a special number.
    username@<yourMachine-ipaddress> is the user account the remote computer is going to connect to on the local computer.

`
ssh username@yourMachine-ipaddress -p 7000                                                                        # connect from external to remote host

${BLOCK/UNBLOCK Internet Access}
Removing your default gateway should do the trick, youll still be able to reach everything in your subnet, but not outside of it. IIRC this should work, cannot try it atm, replace the IP with your routers IP (in the same subnet):

Example-1
$ route -n|grep "^0.0.0.0"                                # To find your default gateways IP:
$ route del default gw 192.168.1.1                # To block the internet 
$ route add default gw 192.168.1.1                # To unblock the internet

Example-2
You can disable your network interfaces, typing "ifconfig" at the command line will print all of your network interfaces.

$ ifconfig eth0 down                                        # you can bring down an interface like this, where eth0 is the network interface you are disconnecting
$ ifconfig eth0 up                                                # when you are ready to use it again just bring it back up.

One of the easiest things you could do would be to create a firewall rule that blocks traffic to the default gateway. If you have a single default gateway providing internet access, this would prevent them from accessing the outside.

Here is an example that might work if your gateway was 192.168.1.1

$ iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.1/32 -j DROP
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1/32 -j DROP
$ iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8     -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 10.0.0.0/8     -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -s 172.16.0.0/12  -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -d 172.16.0.0/12  -j ACCEPT
